## 2.0.6

- new function to [load_learner](https://github.com/henry090/fastai/issues/115)
- unet_config is [Deprecated](https://github.com/henry090/fastai/issues/128)
- while installing fast.ai Mac OS, first, it downloads PyTorch 1.8, then 1.7.1. It is fixed, [now](https://github.com/henry090/fastai/issues/129).
- ```nn_module()``` function allows to rename the model, e.g. ```summary(model)```
- ```nn_module()``` will not move the model to GPU, if ```gpu``` argument is *FALSE* (by default it is *TRUE*)
- [custom loss functions](https://github.com/henry090/fastai/pull/132) with ```nn_loss()```. Based on [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/bigironsphere/loss-function-library-keras-pytorch)

## 2.0.5 

- ```install_fastai``` no more supports extensions. They need to be installed separately by users.
- PyTorch was upgraded from 1.7.0 to 1.7.1.

## 2.0.4

## 2.0.2 

* Hugging Face integration, prediction
* ```one_batch()``` ability to add more arguments
* no need to call ```options(reticulate.useImportHook = FALSE)```
* ```DataBlock``` automatically places data into ```cuda``` if available


## 2.0.1

* ```nn_module``` for model construction
* ```fix_fit``` for disabling the training plot
* all the ```fit``` functions now return the training history
